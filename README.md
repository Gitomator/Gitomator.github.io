# Gitomator Documentation Website

The site is available at https://gitomator.github.io/

This repo contains the Gitomator docs, and is based on [the following Jekyll "starter code"](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

 > _Note:_ The `gh-pages` branch contains the code of the original repo. It is here for reference (as I am removing/changing things fairly carelessly).
